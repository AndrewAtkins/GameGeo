Under Project0 -> Cluster0 the database GameGeo can be found.
In the GameGeo database exists the collection pictionary_pins. The data stored in each pictionary pin is the following:

_id: a unique identifier for the record
lat: a double representing the latitude location of the challenge
long: a double representing the longitude location of the challenge
secret_word: a string representing the secret word that identifies the image
picture: a base64 encoded string that represents the image

The data in this collection is updated by the application whenever a user creates a new pictionary challenge.
